# Retail-ETL-Pipeline-with-Spark-Airflow-SQLite-and-Superset
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Retail Data Engineering pipeline built using open-source tools and designed to run entirely on a local machine (or AWS Free Tier). It simulates how raw retail data flows through an ETL process into a lightweight data warehouse and is visualized in an interactive dashboard.
